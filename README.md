### Data Sources

Students Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Students_Grading_Dataset.csv" file, containing detailed information about the increase and decrease in students grades.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning and analysis

### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Autofited the row height and column width
2. Removed duplicates
3. Found blanks and replaced them with N/A
4. Formatted headers and created tables

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- The situation of the homeplays a major part in determining a students perfromance. True/False

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. A students attendance is affected by their stress level
2. The situation of the home plays a key factror in determining a students academic performance
3. In most cases low stress levels levels equals high grades and vice versa, with exceptions in few cases

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- More study and sleep time should be created for students
- Stress levels should be minimized as much as possible to boost grades

### Limitations

I had to create two tables out of the already existing table, uploading them to a data model inorder to link them. I also didn't make use of the Students ID, Email, Last name, Assignment and quizzes average columns.
